#Design icons and other graphics#

Adobe XD provides various tools for drawing and working with basic and complex shapes. If you want to work on an asset that is created in Photoshop or Illustrator, you can bring these assets into Adobe XD in one of the following ways:

* Copy and paste bitmap assets from Photoshop and vector assets from Illustrator into Adobe XD.
* Export assets from Photoshop and Illustrator as JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, or SVG, and then import these files into Adobe XD.

1.  Launch Adobe XD.
  The Start screen appears. You begin with selecting a size for your artboard.

2.  Select a preset size for the artboard. If you want to work with a custom size, type the width and height in pixels in the text fields under the custom option.  If you don't want to specify any size right away and to create a document with an infinite canvas, click the custom icon.
  The artboard you chose opens in the Design mode. Take a few minutes to read about the workspace in Adobe XD.
At any point in time, if you require additional artboards, you can add them easily using the Artboard tool. See Working with artboards for detailed information.

3.  You can begin designing your assets in one of the following ways:
  
  * Copy your designs from Photoshop or Illustrator, and paste them into your artboard in Adobe XD. For detailed instructions, see Working with external assets.
  * Select File > Import and import a JPG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, or an SVG file created in other software programs and Adobe apps.
  * Drag-and-drop JPG, SVG, PNG, GIF, or TIFF from Finder onto the Adobe XD canvas.
  * Use the drawing tools in Adobe XD to create assets from scratch. For more information, see Drawing tools and Text tools.

4.  Use the options in the Property Inspector to continue designing and enhancing your designs. As you design, you can combine shapes, move, resize, rotate, arrange, align, distribute objects, and more.
Read the following topics for more information:

  * Select, resize, and rotate objects
  * Combine objects
  * Group, lock, and duplicate objects
  * Move, align, and stack objects
  * Work with strokes, shadow, and fill colors for your objects. See Set stroke, fill, and drop shadow for objects for more information.

5.  Preview your design. You can make changes to your design or prototypes while previewing. The changes are reflected in the preview instantaneously. For more information, see Preview designs and prototypes.

  Note:
  Previewing is available only for documents that contain artboards.

6.  If you want to share your design for review with your project stakeholders, you can do so by generating a web link to your assets. Your stakeholders can view your asset on desktop or mobile devices.

7.  You can iterate on your design and generate web links of the updated designs as many times as you want. For more information, see Share designs and prototypes.

8.  You can export your assets as SVG and PNG files optimized for Web, iOS, and Android. You can export:

  * Selected objects
  * A specific artboard with all objects on it; or
  * All artboards
  For more information, see Exporting design assets.

If you want to move on to prototyping, switch to the Prototype mode. Perform the steps from step 4 in the Design prototypes and wireframes topic.

# Design prototypes and wireframes#

You can create prototypes for apps or wireframes by designing all the screens or pages in a single Adobe XD file. You can add artboards of the required screen size and then define interactivity between them to visualize how users navigate through the screens or pages. You can also record the interaction and share a .mov file with stakeholders.

1.  Launch Adobe XD.

  The Start screen appears. You begin with selecting a size for your artboard.

2.  Select a preset size for the artboard, or click Custom and specify a custom size. If you are designing for a specific device platform, you can use the UI kits. Click the appropriate platform in the list of UI Kits shown on the Start screen.

  The artboard you chose opens in the Design mode. Take a few minutes to read about the workspace in Adobe XD.

3.  Work on your design assets by bringing them from Photoshop and Illustrator, or by creating from scratch in Adobe XD. Use the various tools in Adobe XD to further edit or enhance the designs. See step 3 to step 5 in the topic Design icons and other graphics for instructions.

4.  Lay out your objects on the artboard using the layout tools. For more information on laying out objects, see the following topics:

  * Create repeating elements
  * Select, resize, and rotate objects
  * Group, lock, and duplicate objects
  * Move, align, and stack objects

5.  Add additional artboards for each of the screens you want to define in your prototype. For more information, see Working with artboards.

6.  Switch to the Prototype mode to make your prototype interactive. For more information, see Creating interactive prototypes.

7.  Preview your prototype. You can modify the connections between the changes while previewing and see the changes reflected in the preview instantaneously. See Preview designs and prototypes for more information.

8.  Share the prototypes with project stakeholders using one of the following ways:

  * Create a link using the Share Online service. Your stakeholders can view the prototype and interact with the screens on their desktops or mobile devices. See Generating a web link to share for more information.
  * Record a walk-through of your prototype and share the .mov file with your stakeholders. For more information, see Record interactions in prototypes.
